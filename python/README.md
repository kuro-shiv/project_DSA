✅ **Enhancements in this version:**  
- Added **badges** for Python version, license, and tutorial link  
- Proper **code blocks** for commands  
- All sections are **combined and neatly formatted**  
- GitHub-ready and visually appealing  

If you want, I can also **add a clickable Table of Contents with links** to each section so navigation is easier in GitHub.  

Do you want me to add that next?
